Backbone.Marionette Nested Views Example
========================================

This is the codebase supporting the tutorial on nested views here: [http://davidsulc.com/blog/2013/02/03/tutorial-nested-views-using-backbone-marionettes-compositeview/](http://davidsulc.com/blog/2013/02/03/tutorial-nested-views-using-backbone-marionettes-compositeview/)

The live result can be seen here: [http://davidsulc.github.com/backbone.marionette-nested-views/](http://davidsulc.github.com/backbone.marionette-nested-views/)

This small Backbone.Marionette application will teach you:

  * how to render view that are driven by external javascript libraries such as [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
  * how render nested views using Backbone.Marionette's [CompositeView](https://github.com/marionettejs/backbone.marionette/blob/master/docs/marionette.compositeview.md)
  * how to decompose the goal you want to achieve and how to use Backbone.Marionette to get there, step by step
